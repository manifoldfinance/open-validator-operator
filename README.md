# Open Validator Service Broker



## Validator Service API


Validator Service Catalog is an extension API that enables applications running in Kubernetes clusters to easily use external managed software offerings, such as a node validator service offered by a cloud/bare metal provider.

It provides a way to list, provision, and bind with external Managed Staking services from validator service Brokers without needing detailed knowledge about how those validator services are created or managed.

### Validator Service Brokers
A validator Service broker, as defined by the spec, is an endpoint for a set of managed validator services offered and maintained by a third-party, an example would be Manifold Finance offering managed bare metal instances to Eth2 Validators / Staking Pools. Another use case is offering teams customized RPC services, such as using a plugin system to make available an accessible a customized endpoint.

### Validator Service Catalog

Using Validator Service Catalog, a [staking pool operator](#) can browse the list of managed validator services offered by a validator service broker, provision an instance of a managed validator service, and bind with it to make it available to an application running for example in a Kubernetes cluster.

This setting applies to each newly created instance and can allow a new instance more time to get up and running. The setting delays autohealing from checking on and potentially prematurely recreating the instance if the instance is in the process of starting up. The initial delay timer starts when the instance is in RUNNING mode. For example, you may want to increase the delay if your application has initialization tasks that take a long time before it is ready to serve traffic. 	|

| app_start_timeout_sec 	| 300 seconds 	| 1-1800                  	| This setting applies to new deployments, not individual VMs. It specifies the maximum time in seconds allowed for a sufficient number of instances in a deployment to pass health checks. If this duration is exceeded then the deployment fails and is rolled back. The timer starts when the Compute Engine instances have been provisioned and the Load Balancer backend service has been created. For example, you might want to increase the timeout if you wish to provide longer timeouts during deployments for a sufficient number of instances to become healthy. 	|
